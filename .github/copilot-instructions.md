Execution guidelines:

- Track progress with the todo list tool and update statuses after each step.
- Keep explanations concise and note if steps are skipped.
- Use the current directory as the project root and avoid creating extra folders.
- Do not install extensions unless specified by setup info.
- Avoid adding unnecessary links or media; use placeholders only when noted.
